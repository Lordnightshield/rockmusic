She was born with a song in the air
And the day became so bright
It breaks out loud
Girl, it's been a long time that we've been apart
I miss you since I've been away
A child of love angel like
Just imagine you'd come through this door
You'd take all my sorrow away
My body is burning It starts to shout Desire is coming
